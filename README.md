# Artifcat of the CENT Paper, ASPLOS 2025

This repository provides the following artifact required for the evaluation of the **CENT**, "PIM is All You Need: A CXL-Enabled GPU-Free System for LLM Inference" paper published in ASPLOS 2025:

## Dependencies

AiM Simulator is tested and verified with `g++-12` and `clang++-15`.

## Build

Clone the repository recursively

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Yufeng98/CENT_AE.git
cd CENT_AE
```

Create conda environment

```bash
conda create -n cent_ae python=3.10 -y
conda activate cent_ae
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Build AiM simulator

```bash
# use g++-11/12/13
cd ramulator2
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
cp ./ramulator2 ../ramulator2
cd ../../
```

## Artifact Scripts

Remove old results
```bash
bash remove_old_results.sh
```

### Run Simulation

Setting `sequence length gap` to 1 will start full simulation, generating token by token from 1 to 4096. Setting `sequence length gap` to 128 will generate tokens at index of 128, 256, ..., 4096. The final results are averaged on various sequence lengths. We show results using `sequence length gap = 1`, but full simulation takes long time and ~100GB disk space. For example, using 8 threads on a desktop takes ~24 hours for full simulation, and using 96 threads on a server takes ~12 hours for full simulation.

For a quick verification, use `sequence length gap = 128`, which only takes a few hours and has ~1% of difference in results.

```bash
cd cent_simulation
# bash simulation.sh <set threads based on your platform> <sequence length gap>
bash simulation.sh 8 128
bash process_results.sh
```

Generate all figures use the script below or generate them one by one using scripts in sections below

```bash
bash generate_figures.sh
```

### Figure 11

The CXL controller costs are broken down into die, packaging and Non Recurring Engineering (NRE) components. The die cost is derived from the wafer cost, considering the CXL controller die area and yield rate. The cost of 2D packaging is assumed to be 29% of chip cost (die and package). The NRE cost is
influenced by chip production volumes.

```bash
python figure_11.py
```

### Figure 12

Analysis on Llama2-70B. (a) CENT achieves higher decoding throughputs with long context windows and 3.5K decoding sizes. (b) QoS analysis: CENT shows less query latency when achieving the similar to GPUs. (c) CENT latency breakdown with different parallelism strategies. (d) Prefill (In) and decoding (Out) latency comparison with different In/Out sizes, at maximum supported batches for both GPU and CENT.

```bash
python figure_12a.py
python figure_12b.py
python figure_12c.py
python figure_12d.py
```

### Figure 13

CENT speedup over GPU baselines. (a) Batch = 1 Latency comparison. (b) Throughput comparison under the highest batch size that CENT and GPU and achieve. (c) TCO normalized throughput comprison.

```bash
python figure_13a.py
python figure_13b.py
python figure_13c.py
```

### Figure 14

Power and energy analysis. (a) Power consumption, (b) GPU SM frequency and board power, and (c) energy efficiency of CENT and GPU for different stages of Llama2 models using the maximum batch size, 512 prefill tokens and 3584 decoding tokens.

```bash
python figure_14a.py
python figure_14c.py
```
